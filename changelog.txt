Changelog - September 07, 2025

- Adjusted Tuesday's color to a more vibrant pink (#ff69b4) in the day color scheme.

- Updated task name to show the selected date (e.g., "8 Sep") when a date is chosen from the calendar.
- Reduced the "Add task" popup size from 500px to 400px, with adjusted padding and font sizes.
- Reverted to showing full day names (e.g., "Monday") on the "Date" button when selecting dates, replacing previous quick-select labels.
- Ensured task name updates replace the previous date when a new date is selected.
- Modified the "Date" button to show "Today" for the current date and "Tomorrow" for the next day, with other dates showing their day names.
- Cleared the task name when changing the date on the calendar, adding only the new date.

Changelog - September 08, 2025

- Separated the application into multiple pages (Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Filters, Completed, Home, MyWork, Education) using React Router, moving navigation to a reusable Sidebar component.
- Integrated the AddTaskModal into the Sidebar component, allowing the "+ Add task" button to trigger the modal globally across all pages.
- Updated App.js to manage a global tasks state and pass the handleAddTask function to the Sidebar for task addition.
- Created individual page components (e.g., Inbox.js) to display page-specific task lists, removing modal logic from pages.
- Adjusted CSS to ensure compatibility with the multi-page layout, maintaining the original sidebar and modal styles.
- Reverted the AddTaskModal trigger from the sidebar back to the main content area per page, restoring the original single-page design with tab-based navigation.
- Fixed an issue where all sidebar buttons were highlighted when clicking "Add task" by isolating the active class to navigation items only.
- Restored the original App.js structure with integrated sidebar and modal, undoing the multi-page setup and React Router implementation.
- Reverted all changes to return to the initial single-page application state, including the full original CSS with modal and calendar styles.
- Partially reverted changes to restore the state after the multi-page setup with sidebar modal integration, before moving the "Add task" button back to the main content.

Changelog - September 09, 2025

- Integrated UpcomingPage with a dynamic month title based on the current week, replacing the static "September 2025" with currentWeekStart.toLocaleString, ensuring it updates when navigating to weeks in different months.
- Added a static "Upcoming" title above the dynamic month in UpcomingPage to clearly label the section.
- Separated CSS for UpcomingPage into a dedicated Upcoming.css file, imported into UpcomingPage.js, to improve maintainability and avoid conflicts with other components.
- Updated App.js to pass tasks state and handleTaskAction function to UpcomingPage, enabling global task management and removal functionality.
- Modified UpcomingPage to include a clickable circle before each task, triggering handleAction with a 'remove' action to delete tasks from the tasks state.
- Adjusted AddTaskModal to use the current date (08:43 PM +07, September 09, 2025) for today and tomorrow calculations, ensuring accurate date picker options.
- Updated UpcomingPage to display tasks in the "Upcoming Tasks" section with a two-row format: task title on the first row and date/time on the second row, using getTaskTimeRange to include time ranges from timeInput and durationInput.
- Increased the size of the clickable circle in UpcomingPage to 1.5em in both CSS (.task-circle) and inline styles for better visibility and interaction.

Changelog - September 15, 2025

- Implemented Todoist-like Upcoming two-column layout with mini calendar, week strip, and day grouping. Tasks within a day are sorted by time, then by priority (P1–P4).
- Standardized task item layout across Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Home, MyWork, and Education: circle checkbox, priority badge, 3 rows (title, description, time/date with category on right). Upcoming hides the date and shows time only.
- Added priority badges (P1–P4) with color coding; P1 is highest priority.
- Sidebar counts now reflect live task totals per section and project categories.
- Modal updates: removed Today/Tomorrow quick buttons; calendar disallows past dates; added Repeat selection label; Inbox picker sets category (Home, Work, Education). Dropdowns close on selection and outside click; footer aligned with Inbox left and actions right.
- Category pages (Home, MyWork, Education) now show only tasks in their category, only today and future tasks, sorted by time then priority.
- Increased size of task circle icons for better visibility.
